I am currently a second-year Master's student in Computer Science at [UC San Diego](https://ucsd.edu/) guided by Prof. [Julian McAuley](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~jmcauley/) and [Zhiting Hu](http://zhiting.ucsd.edu/index.html). My work also involves collaborations with Prof. [Muhao Chen](https://muhaochen.github.io/) from UC Davis.

I completed my Bachelor's degree at Wuhan University, working with Dr. [Chong Wang](https://cs.whu.edu.cn/info/1019/2935.htm) and Prof. [Peng Liang](https://www.cs.rug.nl/search/People/PengLiang). During this time, I also collaborated with Professors [Maya Daneva](https://people.utwente.nl/m.daneva) and [Marten J. van Sinderen](https://people.utwente.nl/m.j.vansinderen) at the University of Twente in the Netherlands.

My primary research interests are in **AI**, **ML**, and **NLP**, with a focus on **Large Language Models (LLMs)**. I am particularly interested in understanding and enhancing **commonsense and symbolic reasoning** within LLMs, advancing their capabilities in **autonomous tool usage**, investigating the role of **LLMs as intelligent agents**, the comprehensive **evaluation of LLMs**, and applying LLMs for **code generation**.

Starting in April, I will spend the entire summer interning at **NVIDIA** in Santa Clara, California, working with [Gaoyan Xie](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gaoyan-xie-b2170517/) and his team.
