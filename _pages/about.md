I am a **Ph.D. student** (2024-) in Computer Science at [UC San Diego](https://ucsd.edu/), advised by Prof. [Julian McAuley](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~jmcauley/). This summer, I will join AWS AI Labs as an applied scientist intern in the [Amazon Q Developer](https://aws.amazon.com/q/developer/) team.

My research focuses on **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**, and I am broadly interested in **Large Language Models (LLMs)**. Specifically, I explore areas such as **reasoning** ([LLM Reasoners](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05221)), **tool augmentation** ([ToolkenGPT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11554)), and **code generation** ([RepoBench](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03091), [StarCoder2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19173)). I am also interested in building **code agents**. Currently, I am deeply engaged in **LLM evaluation**, believing that *the future belongs to those who do evals*.

Prior to my Ph.D. studies, I completed my Master's degree in Computer Science at UC San Diego, working with Prof. [Julian McAuley](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~jmcauley/) and Prof. [Zhiting Hu](http://zhiting.ucsd.edu/index.html). During this time, I also collaborated with Prof. [Muhao Chen](https://muhaochen.github.io/) from UC Davis. Before that, I earned my Bachelor's degree from [Wuhan University](https://en.whu.edu.cn/). I have also interned at **NVIDIA**, working with [Gaoyan Xie](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gaoyan-xie-b2170517/) and his team on **CUDA code agents**.

> I am actively seeking undergraduate and master's students interested in collaborating on research projects related to code generation, agents, benchmarking, reasoning, and similar topics. If you're passionate about these areas, please don't hesitate to email me.
