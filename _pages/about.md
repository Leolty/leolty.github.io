I am a Master's student in Computer Science at [UC San Diego](https://ucsd.edu/), under the guidance of Professor [Zhiting Hu](http://zhiting.ucsd.edu/index.html). My work also involves collaborations with Professor [Julian McAuley](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~jmcauley/) at UC San Diego and Professor [Muhao Chen](https://muhaochen.github.io/) from UC Davis. Previously, I completed my Bachelor degree at Wuhan University, working with Dr. [Chong Wang](https://cs.whu.edu.cn/info/1019/2935.htm) and Prof. [Peng Liang](https://www.cs.rug.nl/search/People/PengLiang). During this time, I also collaborated with Professors [Maya Daneva](https://people.utwente.nl/m.daneva) and [Marten J. van Sinderen](https://people.utwente.nl/m.j.vansinderen) at the University of Twente in the Netherlands.

> **I am actively seeking a PhD position in NLP for Fall 2024. Check out my [CV](https://leolty.github.io/assets/pdf/tianyangliu_cv_dec_2023.pdf) and [Research Statement](https://leolty.github.io/blog/2023/research-statement-for-phd-application/) for more details!**

My primary research interests are deeply rooted in **AI**, **ML**, and **NLP**, with a special emphasis on exploring the vast potential of **Large Language Models (LLMs)**. This exploration predominantly revolves around four pivotal areas: understanding and enhancing **Commonsense/Symbolic Reasoning** within LLMs, advancing their capabilities in **Autonomous Tool Usage**, investigating the role of **LLMs as Intelligent Agents**, and the comprehensive **Evaluation of LLMs** to gauge their efficacy and impact.

I prefer **simplicity and unity** in methodologies, always seeking to unravel the **limitations of LLMs** and particularly value their **real-world applications**, such as helping marginalized communities and individuals with disabilities.
