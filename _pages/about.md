I am a **Ph.D. student** (2024-) in Computer Science at [UC San Diego](https://ucsd.edu/), advised by Prof. [Julian McAuley](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~jmcauley/). 

My research focuses on **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**, and I am broadly interested in **Large Language Models (LLMs)**. Specifically, I explore areas such as **reasoning** ([LLM Reasoners](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05221)), **tool augmentation** ([ToolkenGPT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11554)), and **code generation** ([RepoBench](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03091) and [StarCoder2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19173)). I am also interested in building **code agents**.

I completed my Master's degree in Computer Science at UC San Diego, where I worked with Prof. [Julian McAuley](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~jmcauley/) and Prof. [Zhiting Hu](http://zhiting.ucsd.edu/index.html). During this time, I also collaborated with Prof. [Muhao Chen](https://muhaochen.github.io/) from UC Davis. Before that, I earned my Bachelor's degree from [Wuhan University](https://en.whu.edu.cn/). Previously, I interned at **NVIDIA**, working with [Gaoyan Xie](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gaoyan-xie-b2170517/) and his team on **CUDA code agents**.
