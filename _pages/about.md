I'm a Master's student in Computer Science at [UC San Diego](https://ucsd.edu/), mentored by Professor [Zhiting Hu](http://zhiting.ucsd.edu/index.html). I am also working closely with Professor [Julian McAuley](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~jmcauley/) from UC San Diego and Professor [Muhao Chen](https://muhaochen.github.io/) from the UC Davis (previously at University of Southern California).

I earned my Bachelor's degree from the School of Computer Science at Wuhan University, where I worked with Dr. [Chong Wang](https://cs.whu.edu.cn/info/1019/2935.htm) and Prof. [Peng Liang](https://www.cs.rug.nl/search/People/PengLiang), and collaborated with Prof. [Maya Daneva](https://people.utwente.nl/m.daneva) and [Marten J. van Sinderen](https://people.utwente.nl/m.j.vansinderen) at the University of Twente, the Netherlands.

> **I am actively seeking a PhD position in NLP for Fall 2024.**

My research interests center around **AI**, **ML**, and **NLP**, with a particular focus on the capabilities of **Large Language Models (LLMs)**. My key research areas include:

- 🌟 **Commonsense/Symbolic Reasoning in LLMs**: Enhancing the decision-making capabilities of LLMs by improving their commonsense knowledge and symbolic reasoning abilities.

- 🔧 **Autonomous Tool Usage by LLMs**: Developing mechanisms that enable LLMs to autonomously use tools, expanding their problem-solving capabilities.

- 🤖 **LLMs as Intelligent Agents**: Using LLMs as intelligent agents to facilitate user interactions and provide assistance across various domains.

- 📋 **Evaluation of LLMs**: Assessing the capabilities, limitations, and practical applications of LLMs to ensure their efficacy and reliability in real-world scenarios.

An essential aspect of my approach to research is my penchant for **simplicity and unity** in methods. I'm constantly driven by the desire to contemplate **what LLMs can and cannot do**.


> A small note 📝: I’ve been living with stuttering since childhood and continuously strive to overcome it 💪. If we have a chance to converse, your patience and understanding would mean the world to me 😇. You may address me using the `they/them` pronouns, but using `he/him` is equally appropriate. I'm open to both 🤗.
