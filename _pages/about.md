I am currently a summer intern at **NVIDIA** in Santa Clara, California, working with [Gaoyan Xie](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gaoyan-xie-b2170517/) and his team. I will be starting my PhD at [UC San Diego](https://ucsd.edu/) in the fall, advised by Prof. [Julian McAuley](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~jmcauley/).

I recently graduated with my Master's degree in Computer Science from UC San Diego, where I was advised by Prof. [Julian McAuley](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~jmcauley/) and [Zhiting Hu](http://zhiting.ucsd.edu/index.html). My work also involves collaborations with Prof. [Muhao Chen](https://muhaochen.github.io/) from UC Davis. Previously, I completed my Bachelor's degree at [Wuhan University](https://en.whu.edu.cn/).

My primary research interests are in **AI**, **ML**, and **NLP**, with a focus on **Large Language Models (LLMs)**. I am particularly interested in understanding and enhancing **commonsense and symbolic reasoning** within LLMs, advancing their capabilities in **autonomous tool usage**, investigating the role of **LLMs as intelligent agents**, the comprehensive **evaluation of LLMs**, and applying LLMs for **code generation**.
